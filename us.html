        <h1>Between Us</h1>
        <p>You’re not what they call normal,<br>
        but you do have an episode of lunacy every now and then.</p>

        <p>I’m not what they call sober,<br>
        for being drunk on you is the most beautiful intoxication.</p>

        <p>We’re not what they call a couple,<br>
        since we can’t stand the unnecessary labelling.</p>

        <p>But I do wish that we could unlearn<br>
        to take each other for granted.</p>

        <p>And I do know this battle between us<br>
        is never-ending and ever-consuming.</p>

        <p>But do I stop wishing for the moon<br>
        amidst the omniscient dark?</p>

        <p>And do I stop hoping for a moment of serendipity<br>
        and a spoonful of romance?</p>

        <p>You’re more than what you choose to reveal,<br>
        and it only pushes you to the edge.</p>

        <p>I’m more than what I choose to hide,<br>
        and it only drives me one step closer to the cliff.</p>

        <p>We’re more than what words allow us to express,<br>
        and sometimes they tear us apart.</p>

        <p>But I do pretend to realise<br>
        that everything happens for a reason.</p>

        <p>And I do know that sometimes<br>
        no reason is enough to be used as an excuse.</p>

        <p>But do I stop dreaming about the warmth of sunrise<br>
        in your embrace?</p>

        <p>And do I stop writing each time my heart bleeds<br>
        to write for you, for us?</p>
